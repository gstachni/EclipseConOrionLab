OrionEndToEnd
=============

Tutorial on end to end web application development with Orion.

This tutorial is based around four stages.

1. Create a project in the cloud, and store it in a repository
2. Add content to the project - the libraries and references to other services our project will consume
3. Modify content - Wire the data, create the javascript objects that will interpret the data, style the application
4. Deploy - store the code, transfer the software to a server

The software we're going to build will read and interpret a published Google Spreadsheet of data that details the names and locations of stadiums in a professional sports league

The software will display the locations of the stadiums as pins on a Google map, that we can open up and find out more things about. We'll build a little mashup of the information with a Twitter search to see what people are saying about the stadiums.
